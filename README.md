# Translator-Overview

Application takes user-inputted text, a user-selected language to translate from (from-language) and a user-selected language to (to-language) translate 
to. After clicking the 'translate' button, the user-inputted text is translated to the to-language and displayed. 

Users can clear the translation by clicking on the 'clear' button. 

Users can also choose to generate a random sentence to translate by clicking the 'generate random sentence' button. This random sentence is generated
by a Random Sentence Generator microservice that scrapes Wikipedia language overviews and returns a random sentence from one language overview. Users
then have the option to copy the random sentence generated by clicking the 'copy random sentence' button. This random sentence can then be pasted for 
translation if so desired.
